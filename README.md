- OLED-like experience with punchy colors: Boost your displayâ€™s color intensity with Saturation and Contrast controls for rich, vivid output. (Contrast 55, Saturation: 58)
- Hardware-accelerated performance: Powered by LUT (Look-Up Tables) blocks running directly on the display pipeline â€” 0% GPU compute usage and exceptional power efficiency from Intel.
- Fine-tune your visuals: Adjust Brightness, Contrast, and Gamma to find your perfect balance between light and darkness.
